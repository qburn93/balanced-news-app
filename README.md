## User Experience (UX)

### Project Aims

The initial aims of the project which formed the basis for user story creation were identified as the following:

- 

### User Stories

NOTE: The **Staff Member** role was renamed to **Customer** towards the end of development. This was based on feedback to bring the role further in line with the site purpose but user stories still refer to this role as **Staff Member**.

Acceptance criteria for each user story can be viewed within the linked GitHub issue.



### Agile Methodology

All user stories were entered as issues in a GitHub Kanban project and assigned labels using the MoSCoW prioritization technique. The live project board can be found on the repository's project tab (classic project section as of 07/22) or on the following link:

[Balanced News - Ticketing System User Stories - Kanban Board]().

Pull requests where linked with a user story when they contributed to completion of the acceptance criteria.

### Design

#### Wireframes

I created Wireframes to visualize the site's design and act as a template to use when developing the templates. When designing the site I wanted to ensure the site looked and functioned just as well on mobile as larger viewports.

#### Colour Scheme



![Background Colour]()


#### Typography

Google fonts was used in this project with both fonts selected for their legibility and simplicity.

[]() - Use in headings.
[]() - Use in paragraphs and labels.

#### Images and Iconography



#### Database Schema

## Features

1. Home Page

    - The functionality of the site is restricted to registered users in line with its purpose to assist individuals. The home page was therefore designed to welcome customers and provide an introduction to make the site purpose clear. There are clear links to encourage visitors to signup and allow existing users to login. The home page is fully responsive and is based on the site's base template, therefore includes the site wide navigation and footer elements.

        ![Home Page](docs/features/features-homepage-min.png)

1. Navigation

    -

    

    - 


    - Administrators see links to manage their profile and logout, but also the link to the user search page.

        ![NavBar - administrator]()

    - Navigation on smaller viewports

        ![NavBar - collapsible]()

1. Signup, Login and other account management pages

    - *django-alauth* was implemented to handle account creation and management of email verification, email address management, password change, etc.

    - The *django-allauth* signup page shown below was extended to request a user's name as part of the signup process. This also demonstrates how the styling of the *django-allauth* templates were altered to make them cohesive with the rest of the site. Forms were styled using the *crispy-bootstrap5* package.

        ![Account Signup]()



1. Filters

    - The ticket list has the potential to become very crowded as more news post are added and comments logged. To ease this issue the *django-filters* package was used to create a custom filterset that allows admins/users to filter news posts by Status and sort by creation date, or political views. 

        ![Filtering]()

1. 

1. Ticket Management - Technician and Administrator Role

    - Users with an elevated role (Technician and Administrator) can create, edit and comment on all tickets. The elevated user ticket creation and edit forms contain all ticket fields which allows tickets to be created as other users and ticket status and category to be updated. Select image formats can be uploaded when creating a ticket as supplementary information. This image can be also be updated or removed.

    - Elevated user roles can also delete tickets in case they are raised in error (deletion must be confirmed). Deletion of a ticket with an image will also delete the image from the Cloudinary hosting platform using a signal.

    - These forms and models were subject to the same validation as the customer forms above.

        ![Ticket management - Elevated user](docs/features/feature-technician-create-edit-view-request-min.png)

        ![Ticket deletion - Elevated user](docs/features/features-technician-delete-min.png)

1. Profile Management - Customer and Technician Roles

    - Users are able to change the first and last name they registered with and their username. The profile also acts as a place to link to other *django-allauth* features to allow the management of email addresses and password change functionality.

        ![Profile management - Customer and Technician Roles]()

1. User Management - Administrator Role

    - 

1. Messaging and Email

    - Bootstrap toasts were used in conjunction with Django messaging framework to report success and errors to customers as they used the site.

    - Entering an invalid url (integer) will direct users to a custom 404 Error page. If the user enters a string as the ticket slug, they will be directed to the home page and be informed of the error.

## Deployment

### Forking the GitHub Repository

By forking the GitHub Repository we make a copy of the original repository on
our GitHub account to view and/or make changes without affecting the original
repository by using the following steps...

1. Log in to GitHub and locate the [GitHub
   Repository](https://github.com/ianmeigh/support-hub)
1. At the top of the Repository (not top of page) just above the "Settings"
   Button on the menu, locate the "Fork" Button.
1. Click the button (not the number to the right) and you should now have a copy
   of the original repository in your GitHub account.

### Making a Local Clone

**NOTE**: It is a requirement of the is project that you have Python version 3.8 or higher installed locally.

1. Log in to GitHub and locate the [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/qburn93/support-hub).
1. Under the repository name, click "Code".
1. To clone the repository using HTTPS, under "HTTPS", copy the link.
1. Open your local terminal with git installed
1. Change the current working directory to the location where you want the cloned directory to be created.
1. Type `git clone`, and then paste the URL you copied in Step 3.

    ```console
    ~$ git clone https://github.com/qburn93/project-1.git
    ```

1. Press Enter. Your local clone will be created.

    ```console
    $ git clone https://github.com/qburn93/project-1.git
    > Cloning into `test-dir`...
    > remote: Counting objects: 10, done.
    > remote: Compressing objects: 100% (8/8), done.
    > remove: Total 10 (delta 1), reused 10 (delta 1)
    > Unpacking objects: 100% (10/10), done.
    ```

    [Click here](https://help.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/cloning-a-repository#cloning-a-repository-to-github-desktop) for a more detailed explanation of the process above with pictures.

1. Change the current working directory to the cloned project folder (this will be a child directory in the location you cloned the project).

1. It is recommended to use a virtual environment during development ([learn more about virtual environments](https://realpython.com/python-virtual-environments-a-primer/)). If you would prefer not to use on please skip the following steps:
    1. Create a virtual environment in the projects working directory by entering the following command in the same terminal window used for the steps above `python3 -m venv .venv`.
    1. Before use, the virtual environment will need to be activated using the command `source .venv/bin/activate` in the same terminal window used previously.
1. Packages required by the project can now using the command `pip install -r requirements.txt`
1. In the cloned directory, rename the file `.env-example` to `.env` and populate it with the information required.
1. Make django migrations using the command `./manage.py migrate`.

### Deploying with Heroku

**NOTE**: It is a prerequisite of deployment to Heroku that you already have access to the following:

- A Cloudinary account, create one for free at [https://cloudinary.com](https://cloudinary.com).
- An account with an email service that can be used to send confirmations and notification to users.
  - Gmail can be used for small demonstration or test projects. An 'app' password will be required for use in this project. Refer to the following Google support article to set one up):
    - [https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/185833](https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/185833)
  - Visit the following Google support article to learn more about GMail sending limits:
    - [https://support.google.com/a/answer/166852](https://support.google.com/a/answer/166852)
  - A service like [SendGrid](https://sendgrid.com) or [mailgun](https://www.mailgun.com) should be used in production environments.

**NOTE**: It is assumed you have followed all deployment instructions listed in this readme starting with the section titled 'Forking the GitHub Repository'.

1. Log in to [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/) and if not taken there automatically, navigate to your personal app dashboard.
1. At the top of the page locate the 'New' drop down, click it and then select 'Create new app'.
1. Give your application a unique name, select a region appropriate to your location and click the 'Create app' button.
1. Your app should now be created, so from the menu towards the top of the page select the 'Resources' section.
1. Search for 'Heroku Postgres' under the Add-ons section and add it.
1. From the menu towards the top of the page select the 'Settings' section and lick 'Reveal Config Vars' in the Config vars section. Enter the following key / value pairings:
    1. Key as `ALLOWED_HOSTS` and the value as the name of you project with '.herokuapp.com' appended to the end e.g.  `example-app.herokuapp.com`. Click the Add button.
    1. Key as `CLOUDINARY_URL` and the value as your cloudinary API Environment variable e.g. `cloudinary://**************:**************@*********`. Click the Add button.
    1. Key as `EMAIL_HOST_PASSWORD` and the value as the password or value provided by your email service of choice. Click the Add button.
    1. Key as `EMAIL_HOST_USER` and the value as the the email address or value provided by your email service of choice. Click the Add button.
    1. Key as `SECRET_KEY` and the value as a complex string which will be used to provide cryptographic signing. The use of a secret key generator is recommended such as [https://djecrety.ir](https://djecrety.ir/). Click the Add button.
    1. Ensure the key `DATABASE_URL` is already populated. This should have been created automatically by Heroku.
    1. The `DATABASE_URL` should be copied into your local `.env`, created during the cloning process.
1. Open the `.env` file in the project directory and delete the key / value pair `DEV_ENVIRONMENT_DATABASE = True` before saving the file. This can be added back after the next step to ensure local development changes will not alter the remote database.
1. Running migrations on the remote database
    1. Open your local terminal and change the current working directory to that of the project folder.
    1. Make django migrations using the command `./manage.py migrate`.
1. Navigate to the 'Deploy' page using the menu towards the top of the page.
1. Select 'GitHub' from the 'Deployment method' section and you will be prompted to 'Connect to GitHub'.
1. Once connected to your GitHub account you will be able to search for your repository which contains the forked 'Support-Hub' repository.
1. Once the repository is found click 'Connect'.
1. At the bottom of the page find the section named 'Manual deploy', select the 'main' branch in the drop down and click the 'Deploy' button.
1. Once deployment is complete, click the 'View' button to load the URL of the deployed application.
